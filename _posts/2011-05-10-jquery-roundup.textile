h3. Instagram jQuery Plugin

!/images/posts/instagram-logo.png!

"Instagram jQuery plugin":http://potomak.github.com/jquery-instagram/ (GitHub: "potomak / jquery-instagram":https://github.com/potomak/jquery-instagram) by Giovanni Cappellotto uses the "instagr.am":http://instagr.am/ API to show a list of photos.  

You'll need to provide a client ID to use it, but the "Instagram API documentation":http://instagram.com/developer/auth/ explains how to do this.

h3. jQuery.handleStorage

"jQuery.handleStorage":https://github.com/jas-/jQuery.handleStorage (GPL) by Jason Gerfen provides a local storage database with AES support.  Jason's example encrypts the data in a form:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#myForm').handleStorage({ storage:'cookie', aes:true });
{% endhighlight %}

This uses the "Gibberish AES":https://github.com/mdp/gibberish-aes library.  It could be used without AES, however, and the plugin will use local storage (if available), a session, or cookies.

A related commercial product is "1Password":http://agilebits.com/onepassword which includes a HTML/CSS/JavaScript viewer for encrypted passwords.  The 1Password application itself is for Windows, Mac OS, iOS or Android, but interestingly their database files include a HTML viewer that can decrypt saved passwords.

h3. Ampersand

"Ampersand":https://github.com/goldfidget/ampersand by Nicholas Johnson is a small jQuery plugin for using "Open Source Ampersands":http://opensourceampersands.com/.  This is a project to provide high-quality single-character fonts.

h3. Morse.js

"Morse.js":http://mattt.github.com/Morse.js/ (GitHub: "mattt / Morse.js":https://github.com/mattt/morse.js/, MIT License) by Mattt Thompson transcribes morse code: <code>$('p').morseCode({ bpm:12 });</code>.

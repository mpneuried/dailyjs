Welcome to part 23 of _Let's Make a Framework_, the ongoing series about building a JavaScript framework.  This part explores supporting touchscreen devices.

If you haven't been following along, these articles are tagged with "lmaf":http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf.  The project we're creating is called Turing and is available on GitHub: "turing.js":http://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js/.

h3. Supporting Touchscreen Devices

Libraries like "jQTouch":http://www.jqtouch.com/ help support devices like the iPhone, iPad and Android phones.  A lot of people are interested in this because building web apps is arguably easier than writing native Objective-C or Java code, and in some cases a web app might be more suitable.  In fact, I've noticed a lot of companies building jQTouch interfaces as a way of exploring an iPhone version of their site or app before actually building a native app.

jQTouch is a jQuery plugin that provides a whole wealth of features, and also includes graphical components to make building native-looking apps easier.  In this tutorial series, I'm going to focus on supporting the more low-level features, like touchscreen events.

h3. A Simple Example: Orientation

To kick things off, let's look at detecting orientation changes.  DailyJS's Turing framework already has support for events.  WebKit supports the <code>orientationchange</code> event:

{% highlight javascript %}
turing.events.add($t('body')[0], 'orientationchange', function(e) {
  alert('put me down you oaf!');
});
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Debugging

Before progressing, let's look at debugging options.  Android devices can use <code>logcat</code> -- take a look at "Android Debug Bridge":http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html for some help in this area.

Safari for iPhone has a debug console.  To enable it, go to Settings, Safari, Developer and enable debugging:

Then each page gets a debug bar:

h3. Orientation Property

There's a property called <code>orientation</code> on <code>window</code> that can be used to detect the current angle of the device.  This can be interpreted to figure out the exact orientation of the device:

{% highlight javascript %}
touch.orientation = function() {
  var orientation = window.orientation,
      orientationString = '';
  switch (orientation) {
    case 0:
      orientationString += 'portrait';
    break;

    case -90:
      orientationString += 'landscape right';
    break;

    case 90:
      orientationString += 'landscape left';
    break;

    case 180:
      orientationString += 'portrait upside-down';
    break;
  }
  return [orientation, orientationString];
};
{% endhighlight %}

This code is from the <code>turing.touch</code> object.  Now orientation changes can be detected and handled like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
turing.events.add($t('body')[0], 'orientationchange', function(e) {
  alert(turing.touch.orientation());
});
{% endhighlight %}

Remember that <code>$t</code> is the shortcut for <code>turing.dom.get</code> -- this is all in <code>turing.alias.js</code>.

h3. Conclusion

Although we're only focusing on WebKit here it's interesting that the existing DOM event library we've built can be used for most of this functionality.  Other than the proprietary <code>orientation</code> property, there isn't anything here that's too messy.

Next week I'll look at swipe events.

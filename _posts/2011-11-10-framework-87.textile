<div class="intro">
_Let's Make a Framework_ is an ongoing series about building a JavaScript framework from the ground up.

These articles are tagged with "lmaf":http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf.  The project we're creating is called "Turing":http://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js.  Documentation is available at "turingjs.com":http://turingjs.com/.

The biggest problem I've had when writing tests for Turing is checking when asynchronous callbacks complete.  For example, when testing the resource loading feature, I wrote tests with this pattern:

{% highlight javascript %}
'test queue loading with no local scripts': function() {
  $t.require([
    'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js'
  ]).on('complete', function() {
    assert.ok(true);
    assert.done();
  }).on('loaded', function(item) {
    if (item.src === 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js') {
      assert.ok(jQuery, 'jQuery should be set');
    }
  });
}  
{% endhighlight %}

What happens if <code>loaded</code> never fires?  Well, the test would still pass.  That's a consequence of the assertion never being run.

One solution is to wrap the <code>assert</code> module with counters that count how many assertions have been called.  Then at the start of a test we can write <code>assert.expect(2);</code> to say 'raise an error if anything other than two assertions are run'.

That's fine, but at this point Turing's test framework always runs tests asynchronously.  If the <code>assert</code> module kept a counter, other tests would increment that value too.  The number of assertions would be the total number for all of the current suite's tests, rather than the current test.

h3. Counting Assertions

The initial solution I came up with was to wrap every assertion method with a function that incremented a counter.  Tests take this pattern:

{% highlight javascript %}
'test queue loading with no local scripts': function() {
  var assertExpect = mixinExpect(assert);
  assertExpect.expect(2);

  $t.require([
    'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js'
  ]).on('complete', function() {
    assertExpect.ok(true);
    assertExpect.done();
  }).on('loaded', function(item) {
    if (item.src === 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js') {
      assertExpect.ok(jQuery, 'jQuery should be set');
    }
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Each test gets its own instance of the <code>assert</code> module.

The code to do this is slightly clumsy, because I aliased the old methods using a <code>__</code> prefix:

{% highlight javascript %}
function mixinExpect(m) {
  var m2 = {}, method;

  for (method in m) {
    if (m.hasOwnProperty(method)) {
      m2['__' + method] = m[method];
      (function(methodName) {
        m2[methodName] = function() {
          m2.mixinExpectAssertionCount++;
          m2['__' + methodName].apply(m2, arguments);
        };
      }(method));
    }
  }

  m2.expect = function(count) {
    m2.mixinExpectAssertionCount = 0;
    m2.mixinExpectExpected = count;
  };

  m2.done = function() {
    if (m2.mixinExpectAssertionCount !== m2.mixinExpectExpected) {
      throw('Expected assertion count was not found, expected: ' + m2.mixinExpectExpected + ', got: ' + m2.mixinExpectAssertionCount); 
    }
  };

  return m2;
}
{% endhighlight %}

It does the job, but is there a more elegant way that doesn't require changing the <code>assert</code> module?

h3. Expectations

I got this idea when I reviewed "Tim Caswell's Step":http://dailyjs.com/2011/11/07/code-review/ library:

{% highlight javascript %}
'test queue loading with no local scripts': function() {
  var expect = new Expect();
  expect.add('jQuery was set');
  expect.add('loaded fired');

  $t.require([
    'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js'
  ]).on('complete', function() {
    assert.ok(true);
    expect.fulfill('loaded fired');
    expect.done();
  }).on('loaded', function(item) {
    if (item.src === 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js') {
      expect.fulfill('jQuery was set');
      assert.ok(jQuery, 'jQuery should be set');
    }
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Each test creates an instance of <code>Expect</code> and adds a list of expectations.  As the expectations are fulfilled, it marks down this fact, then at the end of the test when <code>expect.done()</code> is called it can see if any expectations were unfulfilled.

I made a quick implementation and it's only a few lines of code:

{% highlight javascript %}
function Expect() {
  this.expectations = {};
}

Expect.prototype = {
  add: function(expectation) {
    this.expectations[expectation] = false;
  },

  fulfill: function(expectation) {
    this.expectations[expectation] = true;
  },

  done: function() {
    for (var expectation in this.expectations) {
      if (!this.expectations[expectation]) {
        throw('Expected assertion was fulfilled , expected: ' + expectation); 
      }
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Conclusion

Working with asynchronous tests can quickly get confusing -- sometimes tests appear to be passing but aren't actually running as expected.  The CommonJS Unit Testing spec actually says the following:

bq. The assertions defined above will not be to everyone's taste style wise (or infact behaviour wise.) Authors are free to define their own assertion methods in new modules as desired.

So adding a <code>assert.expect</code> method to your own assertion module implementations is perfectly acceptable.

This week's code can be found in the ajax tests in "commit dc3b41f":https://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js/commit/dc3b41f14a74a49f1622b39c57858e24052ce7fa.dc3b41f.

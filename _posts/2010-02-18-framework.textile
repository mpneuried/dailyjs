*Let's Make a Framework* is a new series about JavaScript web frameworks that I'm starting right now on DailyJS.  It will appear every Thursday in your feed reader until it either drives me crazy or I complete every part.

I'm going to document what goes into a JavaScript framework, and build one as the series progresses.  It's not going to be the next jQuery, it's going to be purely an educational exercise for the reader.

I'm going to cover the following juicy topics:

* Library architectures
* Functional programming
* Selectors
* Events
* Ajax
* Animation
* Module loading
* Plugin architecture

Some parts, especially selectors, will be spread over multiple posts.  This is because trying to cram them into one post will kill me, and I don't want you to fall asleep.

Along the way I'll hit on some fundamental parts of modern web JavaScript:

* Browser capability detection
* Clean, reusable API design
* Benchmarking and performance
* Writing minifier-friendly JavaScript
* Using GitHub!

Do you have a name idea for this framework?  If not I'll name it something boring...  Post in the comments or message us with "@dailyjs":http://twitter.com/dailyjs!
